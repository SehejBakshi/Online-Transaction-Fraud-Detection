The Model predicts, that the probability that transaction can be suspicious transaction 0 which is lower than the average model prediction 0.499. For the selected instance model's prediction is lower, than for % of all observations.

The most important variable is errorBalanceOrig (= 50890). It decreases the prediction by 0.4.
The second most important variable is errorBalanceDest (= 0). It decreases the prediction by 0.034.
The third most important variable is oldbalanceDest (= 4165000). It decreases the prediction by 0.033.
The average contribution of all the above variables is significant.

Other variables are with less importance. The contribution of all other variables is -0.032.
